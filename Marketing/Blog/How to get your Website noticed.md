# Intro
When finding new products or services, there is usually a trigger (seeing someone wearing a nice coat, realising that you need new gloves, etc.).

Consumer-decision journey:
 - **Initial Consideration** (following trigger): 
	 - Mentally shortlisting brands based on brand perception, may be influenced by:
		 - **Store/agent/dealer interactions**
		 - **Consumer recommendation**: reviews, direct recommendations etc.
		 - **Past Experience** (if returning customer)
		 - **Company-driven marketing**: your marketing output
	 - Recollecting recent touch points (seeing a store-front / print advert / social media advert / link from a friend)
 - **Active Evaluation**:
	 - Research product*
 - **Sales Moment**:
	 - Selecting and purchasing one brand
 - **Post-purchase experience**:
	 - Product is road-tested to see if it meets the expectations the consumer had identified with it

\* As the user researches, companies may be subtracted/added to the list that were not in present in the initial consideration phase
