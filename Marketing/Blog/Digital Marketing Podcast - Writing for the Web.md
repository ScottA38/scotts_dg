### Step One: Boil your audience down to a set of principles

Honest picture of audience
Jakob Nielsen
'Your audience is selfish, lazy and ruthless'
- Only thinking about their own needs - "Where is that what I need?, forget all this comprehensive content"
- Lazy - don't want work hard
- Ruthless - will drop engangement quickly

Book: 'Dont make me think' - Steve Kroog
> Quickest way to get what we want, and sacrifice all else

Bombardment of content, so the user is averse to *lingering*

### Step Two: Make your content easy on the eye

Make content simple as possible
- No introductions!
- Short paragraphs! 2-3 lines 
- Short sentences! <=16 words
- Abundant subheadings
- Abundant Sublines (what is a 'subline'?)

Very 'lookist', audience is very disciminating on first glance

> Get to the point, as fast as possible

Start with **key message**


#### Writing Frameworks
Book: 'Letting of your words' - Ginny 'reddis'(?)
>Structure content in terms of 'bite', 'snack', 'meal'

- 'Bite' -> Headline, hook: Statement of topic attention grabbing, clear, very easy to digest
- 'Snack' -> Brief summary of main themes: Even 3 bullet points
- 'Meal' -> Stratified by subheadings referring to bullets or main points of snack

** Good for Landing pages

Writing framework: GUSTA method - longer form writing 
- **G**:  Grab attention
- **U**: Understanding -> Show affinity with the issue the audience has, or the context they are in
- **S**: Solution -> Describe the thing you are selling
- **T**: Trust -> Addressing Questions, concerns
- **A**: Action -> How much is the solution? "Buy it now"! Show how much it is

Kieran - Writing framework: 'Problem, agitate, solution'
- Outline problem
- Agitate -> Extrapolate details of issue, get into nitty gritty
- Show solution

Kim:
> Get over yourself! Assume the audience won't read a word you say

### Tools

'speechify' -> Automated reader which reads your content back to you 
Does it have rhythm and pace?

'onelook.com' -> Alternative word suggestor (with contextual bearing??)

We are more intellectual when using simpler words, the output is more thoughtful
