### Site 'Stickiness'

- **DAU** - 'Daily Active Users'
- **WAU** - 'Weekly Active Users'
- **MAU** - 'Monthly Active Users'

By determining the ratio of one of the above with another, an analyst can determine user 'Stickiness' (i.e: of the customers who create user sessions daily, who comes back on a monthly basis?)

- Measuring site 'stickiness' can help determine CLV (Customer Lifetime Value) 

### Common ratios

> When you look at the DAU/MAU ratio, popularized by platforms such as Facebook, you see the number of monthly customers who interact with your product or service in a single-day window

DAU/MAU => the number of _monthly customers_ that interact with the business within a single-day window (no other interactions outside of a 24h scope)

### What is a qualified session?

The Event trigger that causes impact upon DAU/WAU/MAU metrics should be meaningful to the business aims, i.e:

- For a Personal trainer, it may be people opening up the pricing page (contemplation stage traffic)
- For an E-Commerce business, it may somebody opening up a Product Detail Page (PDP) to see what's inside

Each timespan metric can be compared with another to determine User 'stickiness'
