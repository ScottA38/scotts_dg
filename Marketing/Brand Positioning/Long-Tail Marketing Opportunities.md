> The **Long Tail** is a business and economic concept describing how a large number of niche products or services, each selling in small volumes, can collectively generate significant total demand - sometimes rivalling or exceeding that of a few bestsellers

- **Contrasts traditional ideologies** about focussing on high-volume sales of a limited number of products
	- High-volume approaches are **typically driven by constraints upon physical shelf storage space in physical premises**
- Challenges high-volume sales approaches with a goal of **aggregate success across a large number of niche, specialised product offerrings**
- E-Commerce and diversified product distribution methodologies do away with typical constraints of physical locations
- Term is specifically derived from a 'long-tail' shape within a demand curve graph
