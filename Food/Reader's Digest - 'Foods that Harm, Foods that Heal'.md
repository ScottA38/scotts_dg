### Acne
### What causes acne
- Sebaceous glands overproduce oil, or sebum, secreted through the pores.
- Sebum transports dead cell debris with it as it falls, but overproduction causes sebum to have it's dead skin cells wedged into it's another pore (or it's original pore)
- Sebum overproduction blocks pores with a sticky mass of oil.
- Hormonal imbalances such as heightened sex drive or emotional stress contribute to acne.
##### The 'Zinc link'
- Research shows that many acne sufferers are deficient in Zinc.
- Zinc is abundant in shellfish, nuts, lean meat and skinless poultry.
