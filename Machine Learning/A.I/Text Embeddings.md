**Definition**
'a compressed, abstract representation of text data** where text of arbitrary length can be represented as a fixed-size vector of numbers'

**Compression Technologies**
Originally, compression
To learn the DPR embedding, they fine-tuned two independent BERT-based encoders on existing question-answer pairs. The passage encoder () embeds text passages into vectors while the query encoder () embeds questions into vectors. The query embedding is then used to retrieve  passages that are most similar to the question.
