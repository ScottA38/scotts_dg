ESPs run algorithms on incoming mail in users' inboxes in order to help them **overcome issues like spam and/or phishing email attempts**. 

Why? Because someone who is invested and happy with your email service can be marketed **other services which are paid**. Right, Mr. Pichai?

### Key Factors

1. 'Newness'
   If your email is newly created, then this diminish chances of Email Client trust
2. 'Classification'
   The classification agent running the filtering algorithm on incoming emails via an ESP service will be able to delineate from incoming messages what the purpose of the message is (i.e: what industry the relevant domain name belongs to, i.e: Finance). A score will be logged against a specific sender domain based upon a multitude of factors including sender history
3. 'Spam reports'
   If other ESP users have flagged emails from your domain as spam, your authority score will be reduced
4. 'Read rates'
   What percentage of received email are opened and read to you?
5. 'Email Deletions'
   Whether or not the user or other users have regularly deleted the email in question
6. 'Click-through rates'
   Whether or not the links within email content are clicked on. Click-through rate is dependent upon CTA
7. 'Response rates'
   Whether an email elicits a response or not
8. 'Forwarding rates'
   Whether emails from your domain are typically forwarded or not
9. 'Hard bounces'
