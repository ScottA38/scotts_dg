### Definition

A response header from a web server serving web pages that specifies from which origin scripts and assets are allowed to be loaded.

> The primary use case for CSP is to control which resources, in particular JavaScript resources, a document is allowed to load. This is mainly used as a defense against [cross-site scripting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Cross-site_scripting) (XSS) attacks, in which an attacker is able to inject malicious code into the victim's site.
