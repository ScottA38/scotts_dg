Continuously-moving pixelated noise generator created via [WebGPU](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb) capabilities

- Charles has demonstrated some samples of rendering with WebGPU [here](https://github.com/aczw/webgpu-samples/tree/main)
- It is likely that the parameters to define the 'noise matrix' are defined [here](https://github.com/aczw/personal-website/blob/main/src/shaders/dither.frag.glsl)
	- I'm not good with Maths generally, but probably 'Bayer Grid' has something to do with the algorithm to generate the noise landscape?
